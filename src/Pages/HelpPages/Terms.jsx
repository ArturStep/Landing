      <p>
        Access to particular areas of our website is restricted. At our discretion we reserve the right to restrict
        access to areas of our website, or our entire website.
        Should we provide you with a user ID and password to enable you access to restricted areas of our website or
        other content or services, you must ensure that your
        user ID and password is kept confidential.
        At our discretion we may disable your user ID and password without notice or justification.
      </p>

      <h4 style={{fontWeight: "bold", lineHeight: "2em"}}>6. Your username and password</h4>
      <p>
        Your username and password are personal to you and you must at all times maintain the confidentiality of your
        username and password and not disclose them to any third party.
        Your username and password may be used by one person only, i.e. a single login is not permitted to be shared by
        multiple people.
        You agree that you are solely responsible for any use of this website by any person using your username and
        password and you agree to indemnify us against
        any and all claims arising out of your failure to maintain the confidentiality of your username or password. We
        will not be liable for any loss that you may
        incur as a result of someone else using your password or account
        (whether with or without your knowledge). You agree to notify us immediately of any unauthorised use of your
        account or any other breach of security. </p>

      <h4 style={{fontWeight: "bold", lineHeight: "2em"}}>7. Products</h4>

        We may offer goods or services ('Products') for sale on this website. Your purchase of each Product shall be
        governed by these Terms and any additional terms that we communicate to you at the time of purchase. </p>
      <h4 style={{fontWeight: "bold", lineHeight: "2em"}}>8. Subscription Products</h4>
      <p>
        Some Products may be purchased for a specified term, e.g., monthly or annually ('Subscription Products'), rather
        than relating to a one-off good or service. The subscription term varies depending on the Subscription Product
        that you order. You are entitled to receive the relevant Subscription Product only during the subscription term
        specified in your order. </p>
      <h4 style={{fontWeight: "bold", lineHeight: "2em"}}>9. Contract formation</h4>
      <p>
        This website and the information on it constitute an invitation to treat and not an offer to supply Products.
        When you order Products from us, this constitutes an offer from you to buy those Products in accordance with
        these Terms. Only when we have accepted your order through the website following our receipt of your payment for
        that order shall a contract be formed between you and us. </p>

      <h4 style={{fontWeight: "bold", lineHeight: "2em"}}>10. Our discretion in rejecting or accepting orders</h4>
      <p>
        No order shall be deemed accepted by us until you have received an order confirmation from us. We reserve the
        right to accept or reject (for any reason whatsoever and in whole or in part) any order submitted by you. If we
        reject your order (or part of your order), any money paid by you in relation to the rejected part of that order
        shall be refunded and we shall have no further liability to you in relation to the rejected part of that
        order. </p>
      <h4 style={{fontWeight: "bold", lineHeight: "2em"}}>11. Prices</h4>
      <p>
        The price payable by you for any Product ordered by you shall be the price quoted on this website at the time
        your order is submitted. We may vary any prices on this website at any time and without notice to you. </p>
      <h4 style={{fontWeight: "bold", lineHeight: "2em"}}>12. Taxes and other charges</h4>
      <p>
        All prices on this website are exclusive of all import fees, duties, tariffs, taxes or other imposts or charges
        which may be payable in relation to your order. You shall be liable to pay any import fees, duties, taxes, and
        other imposts or charges which are payable in relation to your order. We shall not be liable for any import
        fees, duties, tariffs, taxes or other imposts or charges which may be payable in relation to your order. </p>
      <h4 style={{fontWeight: "bold", lineHeight: "2em"}}>13. Payment</h4>
      <p>
        We may charge fees or other amounts to access certain aspects of the Products available on this website. We have
        no obligation to supply Products unless and until we receive payment of all prices and fees. You are fully
        liable for all charges incurred under your account whether or not authorised by you. You must pay for your
        orders using the third-party payments service selected by us, such as ClickSure.com. You agree to pay for your
        orders by authorising our nominated third-party payment service to charge your credit card account for the total
        price of the goods or services ordered and the applicable delivery charges (if any). You agree to be bound by
        the terms of these third-party payment services. </p>
      <h4 style={{fontWeight: "bold", lineHeight: "2em"}}>14. Problems with payments</h4>
      <p>
        If there is a problem with your payment (for example, if your credit card transaction is declined), we may
        contact you to make alternative payment arrangements. You will be liable for all debt collection costs where you
        fail to make payment for any order.
      </p>
      <h4 style={{fontWeight: "bold", lineHeight: "2em"}}>15. Cancellation of orders: Non-Subscription Products</h4>
      <p>
        You may cancel your order any time prior to our order confirmation. Because downloadable goods or services are
        available to you, and could be copied by you on delivery, you cannot cancel once we have confirmed your order.
        If you cancel an order in accordance with these Terms before confirmation, we will refund your money as soon as
        reasonably possible and in any event within 60 days of cancellation of your order. </p>
